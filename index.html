    <h1>Fable of esope</h1>

    <h2>THE BOY AND HIS FLOOR.</h2>

    <p1>A little Boy having stolen a book from one of his school-fellows,
    took it to his Mother, who, instead of correcting him, praised his
    sharpness, and rewarded him. In process of time, as he grew bigger,
    he increased also in villainy, till at length he was taken up for
    committing a great robbery, and was brought to justice and condemned
    for it. As the officers were conducting him to the gallows, he was
    attended by a vast crowd, and among the rest his Mother came sobbing
    along, and deploring her son’s unhappy fate; which the criminal
    observing, he begged leave to speak to her: this being granted, he put
    his mouth to her ear, as if he was going to whisper something, and
    bit it off! The officer, shocked at this behaviour, asked him if the
    crimes he had committed were not sufficient to glut his wickedness,
    without being also guilty of such an unnatural violence towards his
    mother? Let no one wonder, said he, that I have done this to her, for
    she deserves even worse at my hands. For if she had chastised instead
    of praising and encouraging me, when I stole my school-fellow’s book, I
    should not now have been brought to this ignominious and untimely end.</p1>

    <h3>THE SHEPHERD’S BOY AND THE WOLF.</h3>


<p2>A Shepherd’s Boy, while attending his flock, used frequently to
divert himself by crying out, “the Wolf! the Wolf!” The Husbandmen in
the adjoining grounds, thus alarmed, left their work and ran to his
assistance, but finding that he was only sporting with their feelings,
and bantering them, they resolved at last to take no notice of his
alarms. It was not long, however, before the Wolf really came, and the
Boy bawled out “the Wolf! the Wolf!” as he had done before; but the men
having been so often deceived, paid no attention to his cries, and the
sheep were devoured without mercy.<p2>

  <h4>THE LION, THE TIGER, AND THE WOLF.</h4>


<p3>A Lion and a Tiger, at the same instant seized on a young Fawn, which
they immediately killed. This they had no sooner performed, than they
fell to fighting, in order to decide whose property it should be. The
battle was so obstinate, that they were both compelled, by weariness
and loss of blood, to desist and lie down breathless and quite
disabled. A Wolf passing that way, perceiving how the case stood, very
impudently stepped up and seized the booty, which they had all this
while been contending for, and carried it off. The two combatants, who
beheld this without being able to prevent it, could only make this
reflection: How foolish, said they, has been our conduct! Instead of
being contented, as we ought, with our respective shares, our senseless
rage has rendered us unable to prevent this rascally Wolf from robbing
us of the whole.</p3>
